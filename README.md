This is a node.js express server that serves a bunch of static html files. the server is connected to 
a mongo database, and allows api calls to manipulate the database. you can view it via https://academy-students-website.herokuapp.com/
and log in with {username: visitor, password: 1234}. (the authentication system here is just a decoration)
